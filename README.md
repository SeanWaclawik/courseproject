# AutoLogin

Project Aim:
Auto Login -- Certain sites automatically lock your account if you do not log in every so often (EMS Charts -- 1 month). It can be a hassle to get a account unlocked after it auto locks. This project would also have the potential for features such as fetching important data, and emailing/alerting user. This project would keep in mind that users may want to use the same concept for other web pages and will be designed to be as generic as possible.
